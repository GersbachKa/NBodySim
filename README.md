# NBodySim
A crude, basic, N-Body simulation

This project uses basic Newtonian mechanics to simulate numerous bodies interacting via gravity. 

Required software packages for the simulator to work:

  1. Numpy
  2. Bokeh - a plotting software that allows for interactive graphs
  3. Jupyter - The current iteration of this software relies on plots being output to a jupyter notebook. This requirement should go away as development progresses, but is currently a low priority.
